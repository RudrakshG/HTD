          <h2>Happy  Teacher's Day</h2>
          <p>On the occasion of Teachers' Day on September 5th, I would like to thank you for bringing us closer to the horizon of knowledge.The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires. Today on the auspicious occasion of teachers day which we usually celebrate on September 5th in order to commemorate the great teacher Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan who was the first vice president and second president of India and also to pay our respects and gratitude to the teachers and their contributions all over the country. Teaching is not a profession it's a place where you see the world, learn from it, the teachers show us the correct path to get to the top, and they find their happiness when we students reach to the top. </br>
            You introduced honesty, integrity and passion to our character. Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart to all the teachers, and parents out there for spending your time, energy, love and care to educate us.Children are likely to live up to what you believe of them.
